					<div class="targeting__item-body">
						<p>AR in real estate applies augmented reality and advanced visualization to represent real-world environments, such as apartments. In other words, the use of AR allows prospective buyers of real estate to visit the property in 3D. This approach saves real estate agents and interested customers time and money.</p>
						<p>One of the most common problems real estate companies face is time spent on apartment or house tours. Customers and realtors book the extended periods in their calendars to look at the chosen buildings. Often, the deals are not getting closed because of the issues that could have been detected in the earlier stages. This is where AR in real estate comes to aid.</p>
						<p>The technology helps the real estate industry show the apartments or houses to the customers using real-time visualizations. When customers see augmented reality apartments, they can better understand how comfortable living in them will be, which heavily influences their choice.</p>

							There are various in-vehicle and off-vehicle use cases for AR</p>
						<strong>In-vehicle AR applications:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>AR-enhanced navigation</li>
							<li>ADAS visualization</li>
							<li>Park assists</li>
							<li>Point of interest highlights</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Off-vehicle AR applications:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Design, prototyping, and production;e.g. AR-powered testing and prototyping processes</li>
							<li>Maintenance and after-sales services;e.g. Training maintenance staff, vehicle maintenance instructions</li>

						<p>Augmented reality technology provides a unique opportunity when making online purchases of household appliances to see it in your environment, with the ability to move it, twist it and view it from all sides. AR mode allows you to watch electric kettles, coffee makers, juicers, coolers, grills, ovens, multicooker, toasters, bread makers, blenders, food processors, air conditioners, TVs, audio speakers, water heaters, refrigerators, washing machines, microwave ovens in augmented reality.</p>
						<p>With augmented reality, it has become easier to make a purchasing decision when home appliances are already in place.

						<p>As global health concerns continue to rise, consumers are adapting to go digital and find alternate contactless ways to discover, experiment, and safely shop for beauty.

						<p>Studies have shown that people can retain up to <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/infographic-the-power-of-visual-communication/">80% of what they see</a>, but only 20% of what they read and 10% of what they hear. These figures show why it is even more important for companies to leverage new technology to provide more visually appealing experiences.</p>
						<p>Companies using Augmented Reality benefit from increased revenue. When customers experience products before purchasing them, it deepens their sense of ownership. Customers who feel as though they already own the product are likely to purchase. Think fashion retail rep that is eager for you to try on that new pair of shoes. When you try them on, you are 80% more likely to purchase them.
							The AR experience is also a great opportunity for companies to educate customers and offer more in-depth content beyond the packaging and label. It also presents the perfect opportunity to upsell companion products or accessories.</p>
